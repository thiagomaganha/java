An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point into a system, routing client requests to the appropriate backend services. 
It handles common cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, and response transformation. By centralizing these responsibilities, an API Gateway simplifies client interactions and enhances the scalability and maintainability of microservices architectures.

ðŸš€ Benefits of Using an API Gateway
  - Centralized Access Control: Manage authentication and authorization in one place.
  - Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple service instances.
  - Service Discovery: Dynamically route requests to services registered in a discovery server.
  - Protocol Translation: Convert between protocols (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket).
  - Rate Limiting & Throttling: Protect services from overload.
  - Caching & Response Aggregation: Improve performance and reduce latency.
  - Monitoring & Logging: Gain insights into traffic and service health.

Spring Cloud Gateway is a modern, reactive, and lightweight API Gateway built on top of Spring WebFlux. It is designed to work seamlessly in Spring-based microservices environments and integrates tightly with the Spring ecosystem.

Key Advantages:
  âœ… Reactive and Non-blocking: Built on Project Reactor for high scalability.
  âœ… Eureka Integration: Supports dynamic routing via service discovery.
  âœ… Declarative Route Configuration: Define routes easily using YAML or Java DSL.
  âœ… Custom Filters: Create reusable filters for authentication, logging, etc.
  âœ… Spring Boot Native: Leverages Spring Bootâ€™s simplicity and auto-configuration.
  âœ… Extensible: Easily extend with custom logic and filters.
